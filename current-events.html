      <h2> "Artificial Leaf" </h2>
    A new device developed by students at Cambridge can produce a type of gas called 
    ‘syngas’ without the use of fossil fuels. Syngas is used to produce different types 
    of fuels, plastics, pharmaceuticals, and fertilizers. When the ‘leaf’ is submerged 
    in water, it uses two light absorbers to produce oxygen and reduce carbon dioxide 
    and water into carbon monoxide and hydrogen. But these light absorbers are not limited 
    to warm places that get a lot of sun; they can also function in cloudy or even rainy 
    weather.
    
      <h2> Record Flooding in Venice </h2>
      Venice is known to have been experiencing some flooding do to sinking into the 
      mud and rising sea levels, but nothing as severe as this has happened in over 
      50 years. The peak tide as of November 17th was at 1.5 meters - almost 5 feet! 
      Since flood records began in 1872, the water has never reached this level twice 
      in a year, much less three times in one week. The historic St. Mark's Square
      has been closed down, many shop owners nearby emptying their stock to keep it 
      from being damaged. <!-- picture? -->
      
      <h2> 'Funeral' for Swiss Glacier </h2>
      Hundreds of climate activists climbed to high altitudes to honor the now "dead"
      Pizol glacier, located in the Glarus Alps, east Switzerland. Since 2006, 
      Pizol has lost 80 per cent of its mass, with only 26,000 square meters
      remaining. Once standing at 320,000 square meters, the glacier is expected
      to have completely dissapeared by the end of the next decade. Warming weather
      has melted the ice rapidly to the point where Pizol is no longer large enough
      to be technically categorized as a glacier. <!-- picture? -->
      
      <h2> Activists </h2>
      <p>
    <ul>  
      <li> <h4> Greta Thunberg </h4>
       Now 16 years old, Greta Thunberg started School Strike for Climate and became 
       known August of 2018, when she was 15. Other students joined her from around the 
       world under the name Fridays for Future. They participated by not to school on 
       Fridays, and instead marching in nearby cities in front of government buildings. 
       Thunberg has won numerous prestigious awards, including a nomination for the Nobel 
       Peace prize in September of 2019. She has spoken at countless conferences and 
       conventions, and her sudden fame has made her a target of the media. Many world 
       influencers, such as Donald Trump, have mocked her for her bravery and action, but 
       she uses this as more reason to keep going. Thunberg has been diagnosed with 
       Asperger’s Syndrome, OCD, and selective mutism. </li>
      <li> <h4> Xiye Bastida </h4> 
       17 years old, grew up in Mexico experiencing first-hand the effects of climate 
       change on weather. Her hometown of San Pedro Tultepec goes from drought to heavy 
       rain and flooding in an instant due to the climate crisis. After moving to New 
       York, Bastida started an environmental club at school and several climate movements, 
       including Fridays for Future. She has now spoken at the United Nations COP84 in 
       2018, and helped to arrange the first Global Climate Strike this month. </li>
