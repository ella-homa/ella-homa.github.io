      <h2> What's the difference between climate change and global warming? </h2>
      "Global Warming" only includes details regarding the warming of the Earth. "Climate Change" 
      encompasses to the more general range of changes that are being brought onto our planet. For 
      example, climate change includes rising sea levels, shrinking of glaciers, and differences
      in the blooming times of flowers/plants.
      <h2> Is the Sun causing global warming? </h2>
      No! The Sun can affect the Earth's climate, but it isn't the cause of the increasing 
      warming trend that has been seen for the past few decades.
      <h2> Do scientists agree on climate change? </h2>
      Mostly, yes. 97% of published climate scientists agree that the human race is causing climate change and global warming.
      <h2> What is the greenhouse effect? </h2>
      The way that heat is trapped close to the Earth by greenhouse gasses in the atmospere.
      <h2> What are greenhouse gasses? </h2>
      Greenhouse gasses include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrus oxides. These gases rise naturally, and make up a part of 
      our plant's atmosphere. When these gasses are trapped between the Earth and it's atmosphere, they generate heat, and make
      our planet just the right temperature for life. But humans have recently been adding extra greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere,
      mainly by burning fossil fuels, which release carbon dioxide waste. The amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere
      has been increasing for decades, trapping more heat and steadily raising temperatures.
    <h2> What's the big deal with the glaciers? </h2>
    Since average temperatures have continued to rise, glaciers around the world are continuing to melt at a rapid pace.
    The liquid water produced from the ice and snow melting run off into rivers that deposit into the ocean,
    rising the water levels.
    <h2> What does global warming have to do with extreme weather? </h2>
    A warmer climate allows the atmosphere to collect, retain, and drop more water. This makes dry areas dryer and wet areas wetter.
    <h2> What is ocean acidification?</h2>
    Water absorbs 30 to 40 per cent of the carbon dioxide released by humans. As humans burn more fossil fuels, releasing more 
    carbon dioxide gas into the atmosphere, more is aborbed into the ocean. The gradual increase in the ocean's pH due
    to this is becoming harmful to marine life. For example, acidification can prevent the shells of shelfish from forming.
    Over time, the ocean's acidity has been shifting from slightly basic to neutral.
    <h2> How does climate change affect our food?</h2>
    An increase in floods, dangerous storms, and other natural disasters has been destroying more and more crops and infastructure
    used to plant, harvest, package, and ship food.
