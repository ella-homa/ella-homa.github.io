        <h3> Water</h3>
        
          <h4> Use Less Water  </h4>   
            <ul>
                <li> The less water that needs to be treated reduces the 
              amount of energy and manpower that would've been used otherwise.
              Small ways you can lower your water usage are, taking shorter showers,
              turning off the tap when you're brushing your teeth, and not letting the tap run the entire
              time you're doing the dishes</li>
            </ul>
             
        
          <h4> Use Less Hot Water </h4> 
            <ul> 
              <li>The energy used to heat up hot water can easily be conserved
              if you used less water. Simple ways to reduce your hot water usage are
              washing your laundry in cold water, taking shorter showers, or taking
              baths instead
              </li>

        <h3> Transportation </h3>

        <h4> Walk More </h4>     
           <ul> 
            <li>Walking and or biking to where you need to go
             saves energy, fuel, and allows you to get exercise
             while reducing pollution</li>
          </ul>
        

        <h4> Use Public Transportation</h4>     
          <ul> 
            <li>Public transport saves around 40% of fuel that would be burned
            if everyone who rode the bus drove their own car</li>  
          </ul>

        <h3>Energy</h3>

<h4>  Use Renewable Energy </h4>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Using renewable energy helps cut down pollution from
           fossil fuels.There are many different options such as solar
          energy, hydroelectricity, and wind energy. Depending on where you
          live there should be atleast one renewable energy oppurtunity 
          that suits your needs.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>  Conserve Energy </h4>
        
        <ul> 
          <li>Conserving energy can be as simple as turning off the lights
          or unplugging the tv when its not in use. When energy is being
          conservered there is less of a need to burn fuel fpor more energy
          </li>

        <h3> Reduce Reuse Recycle </h3> 

   
     
        <h4> Reduce </h4>
        
        <ul>
          reducing the amount of plastic or non-recyclable products
          leads to less of those products becoming and aiding in pollution
        </ul>
        
     
       <h4> Reuse </h4>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Buying a reuseable water bottle or just using the same water bottle 
          stops waste from ending up in landfills, especially if it is plastic which 
          will take over 100 years to decompose</li> 
        </ul>
    
        
        <h4> Recycle </h4>
        
        <ul>
           <li>Recycling allows for less plastic to be made and for less
          plastic waste to end up in landfills or the ocean.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Wasting food causes a need for more food which causes farmers use more land
          and raise more livestock. This has already negativly impacted the Earth when farmers
          in the Amazon started the fire to have more room to raise livestock.</li>

        <h4> Eat natural </h4>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Eating food with less pesticides is better for you and the enviornment
          with less people buying pesticide covered products, people will stop growing products with pesticdes
          since there is no longer a profit. It may be more expensive but in the end is better for you and the planet.</li>
