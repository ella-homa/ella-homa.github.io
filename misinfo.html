      <h4>
     Climate Change is Natural
      </h4>
          <p>
            Climate change is <strong>NOT</strong> natural. Many people cite the "Ice Age" as an example of
          the Earth's constant changing climate, but there is a <strong>BIG</strong> difference between what is
          going on now and the "Ice Age". The difference is that the "Ice Age" occured naturally 
          without any interference from humans while the Climate Change we are experiencing now
          is 90% if not entirely the fault of humans and the pollution we have caused.

              Climate Change is not a myth. Many studies have been conducted and scientists
            have determind that the Earth is heating up rapidly and if we don't do something soon
            the damages caused may be irreversible.
