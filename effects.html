<h3> Turtles </h3>
    <div class="body_effects"><p> As warmer temperatures are increasing, this results in a smaller ratio of male hatchlings.
      In addition, it also increases the intensity of the storms, increasing the chances of doing 
      critical damage to the nests. Many organizations, such as worldwildife are trying to help 
      turles be more resilient for possible future events that puts their life or family in danger.

<h3> Tigers </h3>
    <div class="body_effects"><p> Sea level affects their habitat, making their habitat smaller and smaller- Sundarbans is one of the 
      world’s largest mangrove forests shared by in India and Bangladesh. Mangrove is a type of tree or shrub 
      that grows in mainly tropical coastal swamps that has numerous tangled roots. With the issue of sea levels 
      that are caused by climate change, the forests are getting smaller and smaller, making the tiger’s habitat 
      unbearable.

    <h3> Polar Bears </h3>
    <div class="body_effects"><p>  Hunger and Habitat Issues- As years and years go by, Polar Bears are at a higher risk as we advance, due 
      to climate change. One of the reasons being with sea level. With the constant issue with sea level, polar bears 
      must wait for the ice to refreeze in order to continue hunting for their prey. In addition, they also depend on 
      the ice platform to rest and breed.

    <h3> Ocean Acidity </h3>
  <div class="body_effects">
    <p> When fossil fuels are burned, they release carbon dioxide waste. The ocean absorbs 30 to 40 per cent of this, so the acidity 
      increases, making it less inhabitable for marine life. The atmosphere has been increasing from time to time since fossil fuels since most of it has been burning from car emmisions.
